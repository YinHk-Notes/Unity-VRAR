## Locomotion
The XR Interaction package provides a set of locomotion primitives to provide the means to move about a scene during an XR experience. These components are:

- An XR Rig that represents the player
- A Locomotion System
- A Teleportation System, with Teleportation destinations
- A Snap Turn System
The following sections of this document outline how to use and extend these systems.



| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| XR Rig | MonoBehaviour that specifies a Rig, a Camera Offset, a Camera. Also provides Stationary or Room-Scale options of tracking space to configure the XR Rig. |
| Rig | The base GameObject of the XR Rig. This is the GameObject that will be manipulated via locomotion. By default it is the object that XR Rig is attached to. |
| Camera Offset | GameObject to move the Camera to desired height off the floor. |
| Camera | GameObject that contains a camera component, this is usually the main camera that renders what the user sees, and is usually the 'head' of XR rigs. |
| Room-Scale | A floor-relative tracking mode. When the scene starts, the origin is the floor. |
| Stationary | A device-relative tracking mode. When the scene starts, the origin is the device. The camera will be moved to the height set by Camera Offset. |
| Locomotion System | MonoBehaviour that controls which Locomotion Provider has the access to move the Rig. |
| Locomotion Provider | Base class for various locomotion implementations. |
| Teleportation | A type of locomotion that teleports the user from one position to another position. |
| Snap Turn | A type of locomotion that rotates the user by a fixed angle. |

### XR Rig
The XR Rig is used by the Locomotion System as the anchor for the player.

### Locomotion System
The Locomotion System is a Monobehaviour that acts as the arbitrator for Locomotion Providers access to an XR Rig.

### Locomotion Providers
Locomotion Providers are where different types of locomotion are implemented. Two Locomotion Providers are supplied as part of the XR Interaction package. The **Teleportation Locomotion Provider** and the **Snap Turn Locomotion Provider**. Both implement the `LocomotionProvider` abstract class.

The XR Interaction system provides two implementations of a Locomotion Provider. The **Teleport Locomotion Provider**, and the **SnapTurn Locomotion Provider**.

### Snap Turn
The XR Interaction package provides an example implementation of a Snap Turn Provider. A Snap turn is when the user is rotated some fixed amount when an configured input is recevied. E.G: a joystic is moved to the left, or a dpad is pressed to the right.
